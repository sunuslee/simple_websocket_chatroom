# Simple Websockets chat room
This tiny project is using em-WebSocket working together with ruby
* [Ruby & Websockets: TCP for the Web](http://www.igvita.com/2009/12/22/ruby-websockets-tcp-for-the-browser/)
and javascript Websockets apis to implement a very simple chat room.

## Userage:
just run the simple_chat.rb first
then start a webserver, like
```shell
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
then visit localhost:8000
you will see how it works.
